# 12-gt-employee-tracker

## Description

This command-line application lets one view their employee database and update the information contained in it.

## Installation

Run `npm install` after cloning the repo from my GitHub. Then, run `node app.js` in your terminal. From there, you can navigate through the database as you please.

## Usage

This was designed to create an easy to navigate, user friendly database system.

## Contributing

This was a solo project completed for homework for the Georgia Tech Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. As always, the biggest shout-out to my classmates and TAs who are always ready to problem solve.
